# Angular CLI w/SSR

This is an example application with the Angular CLI and built-in SSR. Still a WIP

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Similar to [Analog](https://analogjs.org), SSR can be enabled by default without using Angular Universal.

Server builds are still in progress. This repository will be updated as improvements are made.
